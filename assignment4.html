    <h2 id="head">TOP FIVE BEST BOOKS TO READ</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>The Brides of Rollrock Island by Margo Lanagan</h2><br>
            <!--here br is used to add gap-->
            <img src="rollrock.jpg " />
            <p>This is a breathtaking book and one that utilises different points-of-view beautifully. I started the book full of sympathy for Misskaella who's largely ignored by her family and the rest of the community of Rollrock. She takes her revenge
                in an unflinching fashion. However, after the last chapter I had tears in my eyes and went back to read the beginning again. Such beautiful writing.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>The Wood Queen/Falling to Ash by Karen Mahoney</h2><br>
            <img src="fallingtoash.jpg " />
            <p>Mistress of Urban Fantasy a.k.a Karen Mahoney gave us two wonderful books this year. One let me be a part of my much-loved world of Ironbridge again and the other heralded a new series about Moth the teenage vampire. I adored both of them
                and will not choose a favourite do you hear? Falling to Ash made me think of super heroes and I loved the tough yet vulnerable Moth. The Wood Queen developed the intriguing storyline beautifully. The dialogue in both was razor-sharp. It's
                my list so they are going in on an equal footing of love. So there.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>The Wood Queen/Falling to Ash by Karen Mahoney</h2><br>
            <img src="constabletoop.jpg " />
            <p>Kami speaks to a boy in her head but one day he turns up in her village. Jared and Kami fight to understand the mystery of Sorry-in-the-Vale and of each other. It's Gothic and spooky all wrapped up with SRB�s brilliant dialogue. Yum.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Unspoken by Sarah Rees Brennan</h2><br>
            <img src="unspoken.jpg " />
            <p>I made the classic error of reading this in pdf form from the publisher then, realising it was far too early to review, put it to one side. All I could remember was that it was ghostly, Victorian and I loved it. I re-read so I could actually
                write something coherent but basically it's wonderful.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Adorkable by Sarra Manning</h2><br>
            <img src="adorkable.jpg " />
            <p>Jeane has a stunning voice and even though at times I hated her, I always loved her too. She�s pretty much an emancipated teen with a self-absorbed family who has carved out a career for herself through social networking and blogging. Michael
                hates her too, or does he love her? Funny, awkward and a hundred percent brilliant.</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
